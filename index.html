<h2>The Explanation</h2>
<p>
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the least costly path between 2 nodes on a graph.
This graph can represent, for example, a travel map or connections in a
network. In a travel map, the nodes (or vertices) are intersections and the
edges (or connections) are the length of the road to the next intersection.
Thus, Dijkstra's could find the shortest path between 2 points in a city.
Alternately, the edges could be the time taken to travel between
intersections, so that Dijkstra's instead finds the fastest path between 2
points.
</p>
<p>

The brilliance of Dijkstra's algorithm is that the shortest path found so far
gets extended first, so as soon as the algorithm finds the end point, the
shortest path is known. If you want to know more about the algorithm and its
implementation, check out

this page which inspired this animation.</a>

</p>
<p>
The spider is the starting point for Dijkstra's algorithm. Once a fly is
placed as the end point, the animation for Dijkstra's algorithm starts. Each
pixel on the canvas is a single node in the graph to be traversed. The
cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) always have a cost of 1. The cost
of tranversing the diagonals in the graph is adjustable by the "Diagonal Cost"
field. If the diagonal cost is 2 or greater, the algorithm finds the cardinal
directions cheaper than using the diagonal links.
</p>
<p>
In the animation, any pixel marked blue is a node that has been traversed. The
boundary between the searched and unsearched nodes is the wavefront of the
algorithm. Adjusting the diagonal cost affects the shape of this wavefront. A
diagonal cost of 2 or greater makes the wavefront diamond-shaped, 1.4 makes
the wavefront roughly circular, and 1.0 makes the wavefront a square. The
shape is most easily seen as a reflection of the initial nodes connected to
the start node.

Diagonal cost >= 2.0

Diagonal cost = 1.0
</div>

<p>
Dijkstra's algorithm works even when the graph is not a simple grid. Adding
walls by right-clicking will effectively disconnect those pixels from the
grid, and force the path to go around.
</p>

Going around obstacles
</div>
<p>
These wall costs are also adjustable, and the wavefront will start to engulf
the walls if the wall cost gets below ~50. At 5 or 10, the wavefront looks
much like ocean waves engulfing sandcastle walls.
</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="engulf.png"><br>
Wall cost = 10. No, the spider still cannot go through the walls.
</div>
<p>
As an optimization, I tried to simpilify the path by finding where the path
turns. These turns are only necessary at the wall corners, so only nodes at
the wall corners need to be recorded and the path can turned into a much
shorter list of waypoints. There are corner cases where this does not work to
identify the shortest path, particularly when the path happens to go by a
corner instead of going around it. These points could be filtered out by
checking the path at the corner nodes.
</p>
<p>
Additional areas to explore: A* (or A-star) search is a special case of
Dijkstra's that optimizes the search path by adding a heuristic function. By
analogy, A* is much like knowing the rough direction to search for the end
point. This optimization is only possible if the graph has properties that can
be described by a heuristic function, a property like having the graph be in a
grid. The heuristic function can then be the Pythagorean distance or the
Manhattan distance. I did not use A* because the animation may have multiple
end points (multiple flies) and I wanted to indicate the closest fly.
</p>
<p>
Originally, I had the idea to see if I could change the path to include
momentum, which can be experienced by moving the spider with the arrow keys.
While I didn't implement this idea, it would be interesting to explore
further.
