## Overview
A 2D demonstration of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path on a
grid. The player is the spider, which wants to collect the flies.
Individual wall blocks can be added to make the shortest path more
complex.

The grid is not marked out. Instead, each pixel is a node in the grid, making
the shortest path shown accurate to the pixel level.
